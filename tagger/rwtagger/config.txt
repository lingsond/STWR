# This file can be used to configure alternative model subdirectories for the STWR types.
# The model in the respective subdirectory must still be named 'final_model.pt'
# For STWR types missing in this file, the default directory is assumed
# NOTE: If an STWR type is specified twice, only the last specification is used
#
# Format of the file:
# stwr_type@name_of_subdirectory_in_models
#
# uncomment any of the following lines to use the alternative models
# (after downloading them and storing them in the "models" directory)
#direct@direct_BERT
#indirect@indirect_FLAIR
#reported@reported_FLAIR
